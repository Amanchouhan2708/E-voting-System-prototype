# 🗳️ E-Voting System Prototype

## Overview
The **E-Voting System Prototype** is a secure, AI-powered web application designed to simulate real-world election processes. Built using Python and Flask, this system enables both administrators and voters to interact through dedicated portals, facilitating seamless campaign management, candidate handling, and voting functionalities.

It integrates **role-based access**, **login authentication**, **real-time validations**, and **auto-publishing of results** — offering a hands-on prototype for modern digital elections. The backend is powered by **Pandas for data processing** and **Excel for lightweight storage**.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔐 **Login Authentication**: Separate secure login for voters and admins.
- 🗂️ **Campaign & Candidate Management**: Admins can create elections, add candidates, and define timelines.
- 🕒 **Voting Time Restrictions**: Voting opens and closes based on election setup.
- 📊 **Real-Time Validations**: Prevents multiple votes and ensures fair polling.
- 📈 **Result Publishing**: Automatically displays the winner after voting ends.
- 📁 **Backend**: Pandas for data handling, Excel for persistent storage.
